example_task_description.cfg
  contains the flow graph example from the task description,
  representing a simple program with a main function that
  branches on some value and then either calls method a or returns.
  Similarly, method a either calls itself recursively or returns.

example_task_description.spec
  contains the specification example from the task description.
  It specifies that at most one call is allowed, namely to method a.
  The given flow graph violates this specification, so your tool
  should output a counterexample.
