Vote.cfg
  contains a flow graph that was automatically
  extracted from a bigger java program implementing
  a voting protocol. Note that methods belonging
  to the program itself are labelled Vote-... while
  external library functions have a different prefix.
  The Vote-prefix is omitted in the specifications,
  however.


Vote_ne.cfg
  is the same flow graph, but cleaned from any
  information related to exceptions.


Vote_v.spec
  specifies that method vote has to be called before
  method getVote.
  At least if your tool is liberal with external library
  calls, this specification should accept the above
  flow graph.


Vote_gv.spec
  specifies that method getVote has to be called before
  method vote.
  This specification would reject the above flow graph.
